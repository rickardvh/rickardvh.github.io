# Ushiro　後ろ[^1]

You and the enemy are both seated in seiza, with the enemy sitting behind you and facing towards you. The distance is the same as in [Mae](mae.md): the enemy is unable to reach you, but could reach you with a one-handed cut by raising their hips.

From the starting position facing the front, turn around clockwise to face the rear, and sit down in seiza. The right foot stays in the same place when turning so that, when seated, your right knee is on the same line as the enemy's left knee.

## Turning and drawing

Quietly placing both hands on the sword, start drawing the sword in the same manner as in the previous kata. That is to say, the initial draw is performed with the same feeling of seme towards the enemy's eyes.

Although the manual does not specify when to raise the hips in Ushiro, it is agreed that the basic form entails first rising to a kneeling position and then beginning to turn. Some argue that this is slower than immediately turning while raising the hips, and they are correct in this. However, it is important to note that at this point in the kata, one cannot yet see the enemy, and thus can only have a vague idea about what is going on. The enemy could be preparing to cut, or they could be reaching forwards to grab hold of one's saya and clothing in order to restrain one from fighting back. Regardless, the distance between the combatants means that simply by raising one's hips, one can easily get outside the enemy's reach and afford more time for a counterattack.

When turning counterclockwise towards the enemy, the right knee must remain in place, as it is the axis around which the body rotates. Because the original seating position is off the centre line, this is necessary to return the body to the centre line on which the enemy is seated. The fact that the enemy is not located directly behind oneself must also be kept in mind when visualising the target of the draw. The feeling is not so much one of drawing as one turns, but more one of turning by drawing: the threat directed towards the enemy is the essential part of the technique, and thus the tsukagashira going towards the enemy to the rear will necessarily pull the body around. The right hand pushing towards the target and the left hand pulling the saya back in the opposite direction will facilitate the turn.

## Nukitsuke

The actual nukitsuke is the most widely misunderstood part of Ushiro, and for this reason deserves special attention. In order to understand what it must look like, one must be fully aware of the distance to the enemy. The distance at the start of the kata is the same as in Mae, meaning the enemy cannot reach you even with a one-handed cut without raising their hips. However, because you rotate on the right knee, your body is actually moving *away* from the enemy. Therefore, it is fully impossible to reach the target with the initial cut unless one compensates by taking a rather large step in towards the enemy. This is clearly described (but often ignored) in the manual: 左足をやや左寄りに踏み込んで敵のこめかみめがけて激しく抜きつける. In English: "taking a step *in* and slightly to the left, vehemently perform nukitsuke aiming at the enemy's temple." The word used is *fumikomu*, which translates to stepping in towards the enemy, and is often contrasted with *fumikaeru*, meaning to step across to the side. "Slightly to the left", of course, is to step onto the enemy's centre line.

The timing of the step and the cut needs to be such that the right knee and the sword stop at the same time. Properly stepping in during nukitsuke also makes it a lot easier to align the right foot behind the right knee as it is naturally pulled in behind, and helps with keeping balance. Draw towards the enemy, and step towards the enemy. That's all there is to it.

## Remainder

Perform the rest of the kata as described for Mae, with the feet exchanged.
