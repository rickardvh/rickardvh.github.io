# Dai-ippon (jōdan)　第一本（上段）

Uchidachi and shidachi stand facing each other at a distance of approximately eight steps holding the sword edge up in the left hand, and perform a silent mutual bow. Approaching to a distance of approximately five shaku (~1.5 metres), both sides draw their swords while assuming sonkyo, making contact with the kensen before standing up again.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no mention of either side returning to the starting position here, but shidachi must return for the next part to make sense. Uchidachi presumably remains in place. Similarly, there is no mention of releasing the kamae, so both sides remain in seigan. These points are mostly consistent with the Goka-gogyō (五加五形) set of Shintō Munen-ryū, to which Watanabe-hanshi and two other members of the committee belonged.

Uchidachi assumes hidari-jōdan no kamae. Shidachi, with strong kigurai, stays in seigan no kamae and takes three large steps in to reach ma-ai. As shidachi enters ma-ai, uchidachi shows the intent to attack shidachi's right kote from jōdan. Sensing this, shidachi angles their blade slightly to the right in response, and uchidachi instead makes a diagonal (ōgesa) cut to shidachi's left upper arm with the kiai "yah!" while stepping in with the right foot.

Shidachi raises their sword in suriage to *tate-jōdan* (vertical jōdan) while stepping back with the left foot, and pulling the right foot in next to the left to evade the kensen. From there, shidachi steps forwards a little with the right foot while striking uchidachi's sword down in *uchiotoshi* with the kiai "toh!". Taking another step forwards with the right foot, shidachi continues with a thrust to uchidachi's chest with the kiai "yeh!".

> [!NOTE]
> This technique of performing uchiotoshi from tate-jōdan with the feet together also appears in Shintō Munen-ryū, where shidachi raises their heels as if pulled up by the sword right before bringing the full force of their body down with the sword in uchiotoshi. It seems likely that it should be performed in the same way here. Although not mentioned anywhere, uchidachi probably needs to pull the right foot back somewhat to absorb the force as their sword is struck down.  
> The tsuki is phrased as being "to the chest area" (胸部), but this almost certainly refers to the solar plexus. From the uchiotoshi, the kata is quite similar to the first form of the Shoden set of Shintō Munen-ryū, where the thrust is to the suigetsu. Furthermore, the same wording is used in the later Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kendō Kata manual about uchidachi's thrust in [tachi sanbonme](../nihon_kendo_kata/tachi-sanbonme.md), where it was clarified as referring to the suigetsu in a later revision (although the "chest area" phrasing was kept for the following tsuki, which is slightly higher).

Again facing each other (again presumably in seigan), shidachi retreats five steps to their starting position, while uchidachi remains in place.
