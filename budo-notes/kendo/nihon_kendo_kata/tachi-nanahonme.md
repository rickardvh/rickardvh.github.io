# Tachi nanahonme　太刀七本目

Uchidachi and shidachi both start in chūdan and advance into ma-ai. Uchidachi senses an opportunity and, stepping forwards lightly and turning the edge diagonally down to shidachi's left, makes a two-handed thrust sliding in along the shinogi to shidachi's chest area.

Shidachi, pulling their body back starting with the left foot in accordance with the length of uchidachi's advance, pushes both hands forwards as if thrusting while turning the edge diagonally  down to their own left, and uses the shinogi on the monouchi to support uchidachi's sword. This action will naturally cause both kensen to rise somewhat.

Both sides return to ai-chūdan with equal kigurai. Uchidachi steps in with the left foot, and while stepping forwards with the right foot makes a cut to shidachi's shōmen without regard for their own body. Shidachi steps forwards and out to the right with the right foot, and while stepping with the left foot and passing uchidachi's body cuts uchidachi's right dō. Continuing with another step with the right foot, shidachi places their right knee lightly on the floor diagonally forwards to their right and standing on the toes of the right foot, left knee raised. Both hands are sufficiently outstretched, and the sword is roughly horizontal on the same level as the hands and pointing diagonally to the front right, edge angled to the right.

During the cut, uchidachi will have lost eye contact with shidachi for a moment, but as soon as the cut finishes, they must restore eye contact. Shidachi must keep their eyes on uchidachi's body throughout their own cut.

After a brief pause in a moment of transition, shidachi moves the sword into wakigamae and displays zanshin. Uchidachi straightens up and, while bringing the sword above their head in a large motion, pivots on their right foot and pulls their left foot back behind the right to turn towards shidachi. As uchidachi begins to lower their kensen into chūdan, shidachi likewise brings their sword above their head in a large furikaburi and pivots on their right knee to face uchidachi to the left, and lowers their own kensen into chūdan.
