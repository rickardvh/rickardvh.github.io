# Nihon Kendō Kata

Much of the information about the kendō kata is taken from the now-defunct blog [はくどー庵](https://hakudoh.com/%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8/) (Hakudō-an), by Sasaki Hiroshi-sensei, erstwhile columnist for the Kendō Nippon magazine and nitō wielder extraordinaire. Since that blog has been "under construction" since June 2023, and only the table of contents [preserved](https://web.archive.org/web/20210207125320/https://hakudoh.com/wp/study/page_0502/) in the Internet Archive, these articles are largely written from memory. If anyone has access to the articles on kendō kata by Hakudō-an, I would be very grateful to be able to read them again.
